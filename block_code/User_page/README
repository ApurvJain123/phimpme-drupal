1. User map:
- Enable User Locations module.
- Set relevant permission.
- In admin/config/people/accounts > User locations > Collection settings, set the Location form weight to a high number, then pull the Coordinate Choose to top.
Now we can change user location in "Edit" with the support of Gmap (must check Use a Google Map to set latitude and longitude in admin/config/content/location first).
- To show the map, create a block by Views, showing based on user:
Fields: Location
Format: GMap
Contextual filters: User:Uid

- Set the display of the block to make it show in user/* page.
